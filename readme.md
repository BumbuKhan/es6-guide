#ECMAScript 6 Features

#Arrows

[Arrows](https://github.com/dnbard/es6-guide/blob/master/arrows.md) are a function shorthand using the => syntax. They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript. They support both expression and statement bodies. Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical this as their surrounding code.
