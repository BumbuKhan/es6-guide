#ECMAScript 6 Features

##Arrows [==>](https://github.com/dnbard/es6-guide/blob/master/arrows.md)

Arrows are a function shorthand using the => syntax. They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript. They support both expression and statement bodies. Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical this as their surrounding code.

##Classes [==>](https://github.com/dnbard/es6-guide/blob/master/classes.md)

ES6 classes are a simple sugar over the prototype-based OO pattern. Having a single convenient declarative form makes class patterns easier to use, and encourages interoperability. Classes support prototype-based inheritance, super calls, instance and static methods and constructors.
